## About this project

The goal of this test project is to create a small application (using PHP and whatever other technologies you feel are pertinent) that encapsulates the following functionality:

- A translator (paying member or free site user) can register for the application.

- Upon registering, the translator can:

create a new mini-glossary (see below for the definition of a mini-glossary),

search/view all mini-glossaries, and

add/suggest a new translation of a term in another translator’s mini-glossary.

What is a mini-glossary?

For the purpose of this project, a “mini-glossary” will be defined as a glossary that consists of a minimum of 3 terms and a maximum of 5 terms on a particular topic or subject matter. Each term can be translated into as many languages as possible by the glossary owner or anyone else using the application.
